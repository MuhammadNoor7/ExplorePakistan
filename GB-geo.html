            <h2>Attabad Lake</h2>
            <img src="/Image Provinces/attabad.lake.jpg" alt="Tourism ">
            <p>In 2010, a disastrous landslide claimed the lives of 20 people in the Gojal region of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. This very landslide resulted in the water from the Hunza River being blocked for five months and formed one of the most beautiful lakes in Pakistan , the Attabad Lake. Today, the existence of Attabad Lake reminds many of the tragic loss of life but its beautiful turquoise water surrounded by snow-capped mountains also provides tourists and locals with a sense of tranquility.

            <p>The bridge was built during the time of British occupation of the valley in Shishkat village in Gojal Valley, however, during the construction of the Karakoram Highway, the bridge was moved from Shishkat to Hussaini Village in 1968 as ordered by the Mir of HunzaMuhammad Jamal Khan to connect Hussaini village to Zar .Regular aspects of travel through this region include the rickety cable and plank bridges that cross Northern Pakistanâ€™s mountain streams and rivers. Among these is the Hussaini Hanging Bridge, crossing Borit Lake in the Upper Hunza. This rope bridge is both long and poorly maintained. Many planks are missing, and strong winds shake the bridge as you cross it.
