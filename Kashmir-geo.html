            <h2>Chitral Gol Lake</h2>
            <img src="./Image Provinces/Chitral Gol Lake.jpg" alt="Tourism ">
            <p> The history of National Lake Chitral Gol is as rich and intriguing as the landscapes that encompass it. Established in 1984, this national lake in the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, was created with the objective of preserving the region's exceptional biodiversity and unique cultural heritage.This park includes three valleys. Several glaciers also lie in the park through which several springs make their way and ultimately form a stream which runs 18 kilometres. The cold water of this stream flows towards the east, into the River Chitral. The park is rich in trees particularly cedar trees. The park also serves to provide shelter to a vast bio-diversity, especially markhor, an endangered wild goat species.

            <h2>Tolipir</h2>
            <img src="./Image Provinces/Tollipeer.jpg" alt="Tourism ">
            <p> Tolipir  is a hilltop area situated in Rawalakot Tehsil in the Poonch District of Azad Kashmir. Its approximate elevation is about 9,000 ft above sea level. It is about 30 km, or a 120-minute drive, from Rawalakot in Azad Kashmir . Abbaspur, Bagh, and Poonch River can be viewed from Toli Pir. It is a popular tourist destination in the region, attracting thousands in the summer months.The road to this resort is not well-maintained, as it is a single track with many bends and blind curves. But the route to this location is also beautiful. Anyone who doesn't have prior driving experience in such areas should hire a car with a local driver that knows the roads and region well, especially if they must return late at night. Sedans, however, can easily reach there. We would suggest exploring the area at least as far as the top by foot, and you'll discover that clouds, such as in heaven, surround it.
