Introduction
The Explore Pakistan website is an interactive and visually appealing static web project designed to promote tourism and geographical awareness across Pakistan. Built using HTML and CSS, it serves as a beginner-friendly platform for showcasing the country’s cultural and natural diversity.

Explanation
The site includes dedicated pages for each province—Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan, and Gilgit-Baltistan—highlighting their unique destinations and historical significance. An informative About Us page outlines the project's purpose, while a Geographical History page explores the evolution of Pakistan’s terrain. The layout utilizes multiple CSS stylesheets for components like navigation bars and footers, with dropdown menus enabling smooth navigation. Fully responsive, the website ensures compatibility across devices, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.
