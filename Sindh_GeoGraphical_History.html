            <p> Mohenjo-daro or Mound of the Dead is an archaeological site in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan. Built c. 2500 BCE, it was the largest settlement of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico.
                With an estimated population of at least 40,000 people, Mohenjo-daro prospered for several centuries, but by c. 1700 BCE had been abandoned, along with other large cities of the Indus Valley Civilization.
                The site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980, the first site in South Asia to be so designated.The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.</p>

            <img src="./Image Provinces/lownsone Bridge.jpg" alt="Thatta">
            <p>
                The Lansdowne Bridge over the Indus at Sukkur was one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century. The longest cantilever bridge ever built, it had to support the load of heavy steam locomotives. The bridge was inaugurated on March 25, 1889. The Ayub Bridge was built immediately adjacent to the bridge in 1962, to separate the road and Railway traffic. Hence the photographs of the Landsdown Bridge usually also show the Ayub Bridge.</p>
